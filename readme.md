# Vaccination Schedule Notifier

## üìù Purpose

Welkin Mauritius is one of the vaccination centers available across Mauritius. They use Acuity Scheduling for their vaccination appointment booking system. 

Unfortunately they do not provide a way of automatically notifying people whenever appointments are available for booking. If you are a busy person and want to know when you can book an appointment, you are probably out of luck. They only way to know is to frequently visit their site.
